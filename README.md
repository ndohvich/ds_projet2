# Analyze data from education systems

You are a Data Scientist in an EdTech start-up, called academy, which offers online training content for high school and university level audiences. Mark, your manager, has invited you to a meeting to present the company's international expansion project. He entrusts you with a first mission of exploratory analysis, to determine if the data on education from the World Bank can inform the expansion project.

Here are the different questions that Mark would like to explore, which you wrote down during the meeting:

1. What are the countries with a high potential of customers for our services?
2. For each of these countries, what will be the evolution of this customer potential?
3. In which countries should the company operate in priority?
